/**
 * binary_tree_insert_right - Inserts a node as the right-child of another node
 * @parent: Pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
 * @value: Value to store in the new node
 *
 * Description: This function inserts a new node with the given value as the
 *              right-child of the specified parent node. If the parent node
 *              already has a right-child, the new node takes its place, and
 *              the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.
 *
 * Return: Pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
