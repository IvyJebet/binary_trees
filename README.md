README File: Team Project on Binary Trees

Learning Objectives
Our team aims to achieve comprehensive understanding and proficiency in the following areas related to binary trees:

Understanding Binary Trees:

What is a binary tree?
How does it differ from other tree data structures?
What are its fundamental properties and characteristics?
Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree:

Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Understand the unique properties and advantages of BSTs for searching and sorting operations.
Time Complexity Gain:

Explore the potential gain in terms of time complexity when using binary trees compared to linked lists for various operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.
Binary Tree Metrics:

Define and comprehend the concepts of depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
Discuss how these metrics impact the efficiency and performance of binary tree operations.
Traversal Methods:

Learn about the various traversal methods used to navigate through a binary tree efficiently, including:
Inorder traversal
Preorder traversal
Postorder traversal
Understand the application scenarios and advantages of each traversal method.
Types of Binary Trees:

Explore different types of binary trees, including:
Complete binary trees
Full binary trees
Perfect binary trees
Balanced binary trees
Discuss the defining characteristics and properties of each type.
